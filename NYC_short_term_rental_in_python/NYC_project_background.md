# NYC Short Term Rental Analysis (Jan-Jul, 2019)
Project Background

Pillow Palooza is a start-up focused on disrupting the traditional real estate market by offering short-term rental options for travelers. The company has seen a significant increase in demand for short-term rentals in New York City but wants to better understand the market to optimize its business strategy.

Pillow Palooza has collected data from various sources on Airbnb listings in New York City to gain insight into the market. The company now plans to analyze this data using its internal teams to provide recommendations on how to maximize revenue and occupancy rates for their short-term rental properties.

* Samantha Patel, CEO: She will be interested in the insights gained from the project to determine which neighborhoods and property types the company should invest in and how to price their rentals to remain competitive in the market.

* John Kim, VP of Data: He will be interested in the insights gained from the project to understand how data can be used to drive business decisions and to identify any trends or patterns that can inform future projects or analyses. John may also be interested in exploring machine learning or predictive modeling to forecast demand for short-term rentals in different neighborhoods.

* Emily Chen, Head of Marketing: She will be interested in the insights gained from the project to identify which neighborhoods and property types are most popular among potential guests and to develop targeted marketing campaigns to attract those guests.

* Michael Lee, Head of Finance: He will be interested in the insights gained from the project to identify which neighborhoods and property types generate the highest revenue and to determine how to price rentals to maximize profitability.

The main goal of the analysis is to gain insights into the short-term rental market in New York City and provide valuable information to assist Pillow Palooza, a start-up, in making informed business decisions. Through the analysis, we aim to uncover key trends in popular neighborhoods, rental prices, property types, length of stay, and demand over time. These insights will help Pillow Palooza identify promising neighborhoods for investment, determine the optimal property types to focus on, and establish competitive rental pricing strategies.
